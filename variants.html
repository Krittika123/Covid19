               <h4 class="h4">The omicron variant of COVID-19 has become the dominant strain of the virus circulating in the U.S. and the rest of 
                the world. It's more easily spread than previous strains because it has more mutations than any other variant so far. 
                Many of the mutations are in the spike protein, which relates to how the virus is spread.</h4>

               <h4 class="h4">The Delta variant of COVID-19 has been called a variant of concern by WHO because of its increased transmissibility and 
                increased ability to cause a severe form of the disease. Where the Delta variant is identified, it quickly and efficiently 
                spreads between people.  </h4>

                 192 locations worldwide (as of 3 December 2021). Alpha is estimated to be around 50% more contagious than the original Wuhan 
                 strain, although there is considerable variation between studies. </h4>

               <h4 class="h4">Beta  was first identified in South Africa. All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into 
                 new versions or variants.These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive.

                 local strains in that country. Canada has reported more than 15 000 cases to date.The Gamma variant has some of the same 
                 mutations as the Alpha and Beta which allow it to attach more easily to human cells.</h4>

                 vaccines or past COVID infections.The mutations give this coronavirus variant of concern a means to totally evade specific monoclonal
